PyBank Solution
In this repository you can find a Python script to analyze the PyBank financial records. The financial dataset called “budget_data.csv” can be found under PyBank/Resources folder and the output under the PyBank/Analysis folder. The output is a .txt file called “PyBank_analysis”, which is generating after running the main.py file. Results are also visible in the terminal. 
The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses" and the results contains the following:

•	The total number of months included in the dataset
•	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The main.py contains the following steps:
Open and read cvs file.
Loop the csv file.
Use of lists to store the data.
Use of conditional “if” statements.
Use SUM and LEN functions.
Print the analysis to the terminal.
Export a text file with the results.
PyPoll Solution
In this repository you can find a Python script to analyze the PyPoll election records. The dataset called “election_data.csv” can be found under PyPoll/Resources folder and the output under the PyPoll/Analysis folder. The output is a .txt file called “PyPoll_analysis”, which is generating after running the main.py file. Results are also visible in the terminal. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
•	The total number of votes cast
•	A complete list of candidates who received votes
•	The percentage of votes each candidate won
•	The total number of votes each candidate won
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote

The main.py contains the following steps:
Open and read cvs file.
Loop the csv file.
Use of lists and dictionaries to store the data.
Use of conditional “if” statements.
Zip dictionaries and loop dictionaries
Print the analysis to the terminal.
Export a text file with the results.
